Conditions for the script commands:
- Before processing an image the user has to load it from a file. This will store the image into
  the hashmap of the model. Therefore, load will always be the first command introduced.
- After processing an image, one can save it to a new file. The user cannot save an non-existent
  picture. They would have to load and process it according to their preference and then save it to
  the desired file.
- After a user quits the game they cannot process images anymore. Thus, quit would always be the
  last command introduced.
